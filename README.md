# sentiment-analysis
The projects attached portrays the sentiment analysis on a synthetic (fake, semi-randomly generated) twitter data in a csv file named project_twitter_data.csv which has the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet. The project also contains words that express positive sentiment and negative sentiment, in the files positive_words.txt and negative_words.txt.

The program computes how positive or negative each tweet is.  The result is stored in a resulting_data.csv and reveales columns for the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score for each tweet.
